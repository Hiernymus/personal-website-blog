# personal-website-blog
It's my personal space.
I"ll use github page to give a url for this later.
It's base vite.

If you want to take a look to my personal space,
you should use these commands:
1. git clone https://github.com/Hiernymus/personal-website-blog
2. cd personal-website-blog/pages-code
3. pnpm install
4. pmpm vite
End.
